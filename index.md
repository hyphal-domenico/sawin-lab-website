# Welcome to the Sawin Lab!

We are interested in cell polarity and stress. We mainly use the yeast _Schizosaccharomyces pombe_ as a model organism and apply a variety of techinques including genetics, microscopy, and proteomics.

Our laboratory is interested in two main areas related to cellular and cytoskeletal organisation: 1) the molecular mechanisms underlying microtubule nucleation; and 2) the regulation of cell polarity, in a systems context, under both normal and stress conditions. In both areas we use the fission yeast _Schizosaccharomyces pombe_ as a model eukaryotic organism. We combine classical and molecular genetic analysis with live-cell fluorescence microscopy, biochemistry, proteomics and computational modelling.
