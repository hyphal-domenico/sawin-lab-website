# Welcome to the Sawin Lab!

We are interested in eukaryotic cellular organisation. We mainly use the yeast _Schizosaccharomyces pombe_ as a model organism, and we combine classical and molecular genetic analysis with live-cell fluorescence microscopy, biochemistry, proteomics/phosphoproteomics, and structural biology methods.

Our current main interest is the regulation of cell polarity, under both normal and stress conditions. We also continue to study the molecular mechanisms underlying nucleation of the microtubule cytoskeleton.
