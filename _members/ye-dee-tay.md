Tay is from Malaysia. He completed his Biomedical Sciences degree in the University of Hull in 2005. He then moved to the University of Oxford to study homologous recombination in yeast under CRUK and Clarendon Scholarships. After his PhD, Tay started his first postdoc in Prof. Iain Hagan’s lab in CRUK Manchester Institute (aka Paterson Institute) and began to study cell cycle using another yeast model, i.e. fission yeast. In summer 2014, Tay joined the Sawin’s lab to investigate the molecular mechanisms regulating cell polarity in fission yeast.
