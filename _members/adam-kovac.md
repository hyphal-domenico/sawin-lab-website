Adam is from somewhere in Europe. Adam got his bachelor’s degree in Molecular Biology from The University of Edinburgh. As undergraduate student he has carried out projects in three different research groups, working on CRISPR gene editing in green algae, regulation of gene expression by histone modifications in murine ES cells and regulation of meiotic spindle assembly in Drosophila oocytes. Currently working with yeast, he can attest to it being the best model system there is. Right now Adam is trying to find out how S. pombe cells sense stress. Besides being a PhD student he is also the lab’s FACS expert.
